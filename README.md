Large language model (LLM)-driven multi-agent systems (MAS) are transforming how humans and AIs collaboratively generate ideas and artifacts. While existing surveys provide comprehensive overviews of MAS infrastructures, they largely overlook the dimension of creativity, including how novel outputs are generated and evaluated, how creativity informs agent personas, and how creative workflows are coordinated.

**This survey offers a structured framework and roadmap for advancing the development, evaluation, and standardization of creative MAS.**

## :page_with_curl: Introduction
**MAS** comprises multiple autonomous entities: software agents, robots, or human-AI hybrids. This structure enables emergent collaboration and richer exploration of open-ended creative spaces, significantly underlying the practice for computational creativity.
Here, **computational creativity** refers to the creation of artifacts‚Äîsuch as ideas, behaviors, or solutions‚Äîthat are both novel and valuable, demonstrating clear usefulness or appeal rather than being random.

This survey focuses on systems whose inputs and outputs span text and images. We aim to map the current landscape of techniques, datasets, evaluations, and challenges to foster and measure creativity in such multimodal and heterogeneous systems. By analyzing how different agents interact, we reveal how collaborative structures can unlock creative potentials that exceed what isolated LLMs or individuals can achieve.
